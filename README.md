# Heart Attack Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on medical data. 

## The Dataset
The medical data contains 12 attributes:

- Age  
- Gender
- Chest pain type    
- Blood pressure  
- Cholesterol   
- Blood sugar    
- ECG results   
- Maximum heart rate  
- Exertional chest pain trigger   
- Number of blood vessels   
- Target column (0 = low chance, 1 = high chance)

The dataset is stored in heart.csv.

## Modelling
 Three machine learning models were trained:

- Support Vector Machine    
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors

The best result with over 85% accuracy was achieved using Support Vector Machine.

## Summary

The results show that machine learning algorithms can reasonably predict the probability of a heart attack based on medical tests. With more data and risk factors, the accuracy can improve.   

In summary, artificial intelligence and health data have the potential to create tools that identify those at higher risk of heart disease earlier. With validation on real data, such models can assist clinicians in making more informed decisions. Still, further research is needed to operationalize these findings in real-world healthcare settings.
